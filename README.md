# Insurance Application README

## Overview
This project is a web-based insurance application that allows administrators to manage claims and detect fraudulent activity. The system offers distinct interfaces for administrators and users, providing a streamlined experience for claims submission and monitoring, while supporting a data-driven fraud detection model.

## Features
- **Claim Management**: Admins can view and monitor all insurance claims.
- **Fraud Detection**: Admins have tools to assess and confirm fraudulent claims.
- **Blacklisting**: Users with suspicious behavior can be blacklisted, limiting their access.
- **User Dashboard**: Users have a dashboard to view and manage their own claims.
- **Data Analytics**: Embedded Tableau dashboard gives admins insights into claims data and fraud trends.
